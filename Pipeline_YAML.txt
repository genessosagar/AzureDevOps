ASP.NET core project we are building

Create a new pipeline
- Azure Repos Git (YAML)
- Trigger - None, Master, other branch name
- pool - Agent pool what image to use - ubuntu etc
- Variables - 
- steps
    - script - Commandline command

We can make use of the show assistance to generate the yaml file
Repeat this show assistance for all restore, build, publish and publish build artifacts tasks for a dotnet project
Give Display name for them

Publish Build Artifacts is deprecated instead use Pipeline Aritfacts

Pipeline Artifacts
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/artifacts/pipeline-artifacts?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml

Note:
When we create a yaml pipeline that code/yaml pipeline will be stored in the same AZURE repos repository

- Enable continuous integration in  pipeline at the triggers section by specifying the master branch
- And the commit the chages to master branch and we will see the pipeline starts building

## Override the yaml configuration file from here
Go to the pipelines
Select the desired pipeline
Open the yaml pipeline code and select the more options (three dots) -> Triggers
Here we have an option of
- Override the YAML continuous integration trigger from here
- Select the above option and make the config changes

Note: Triggers tab will always override what is mentioned in yaml file


USING TEMPLATES TO BUILD MULTIPLE CONFIGURATIONS
------------------------------------------------
# In classic Build pipelines we have a concept of Task group - which will group the tasks
The same feature is not available in yaml pipelines
So we have a concept of yaml templates

Create a directory in the Azure Devops code repository
Create a YAML file
In this YAML file we will have 
    - Steps and tasks to be grouped
    - Parameters - which will be accepted as a inputs - Syntax - ${{paramters.parameter_name}}
    - variables - are the static ones -> this is the syntax $(variable_name)
