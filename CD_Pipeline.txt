------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We can deploy the application in any on of the following Azure compute options
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Azure App Service - PaaS
* Virtual Machines and VM Scalesets - IaaS
* Serverless Computing
* Containers

Go to the
portal.azure.com

Go to App Services -> 
Create 3 app services -> One for Dev, QA and Prod
Select the subscription
Create a Resource Group
Name of the Instance
Publish is code
Runtime Stack -> .NET 6 (LTS)
Operating System -> Windows
Region -> Central US

App Service Plan -> By default a plan gets created rename it as we want
usually use the same plan for Dev, QA, UAT and for prod use a different plan

Go to the prod app service -> Go to Deployment slots -> Add a slot with a name of our choice - staging -> 
Clone settings -> from the same app service

* Now we need to make connection from Azure DevOps to Azure App Service
* Go to project settings and create service connection
* Service connections - if we want AWS / GCP we can connect using this 
* Connect to Azure Resource Manager
* We get 4 options
    - Service principal (automatic)
    - Service principal (manual)
    - Managed Identity
    - Publish profile
* Select automatic and Next
* Scope level - Subscription
* Select the desired subscription and resource group
* Select Grant access permissions to all pipelines

-> Go to Azure portal after creating service connection
-> Active Directory - Our directory name
-> App Registrations - Observe the new service principal created
-> Go to the Resource Manager and we can see the IAM section our identity ->

In Azure DevOps we have

RELEASE PIPELINES
-----------------
-> Click Release tab

-> Go back to pipeline
-> We want to deploy artifacts into the app service -> click on Artifacts
-> Create new stages for QA and Production
-> For Production - Go to the stage and select the staging slot as well
-> To move to the production from staging slot -> Add one more task
-> Add - Azure App Service Manage
-> Add approvals between Dev to QA and to Prod
-> For production do pre deployment approval
-> Create release
-> Do the continuous deployment as well
-> If we have a requirement to deploy the app parallely on both Dev and QA then ->
